Hello world!

Motivation is overrated, so I am going to try discipline.

I want to bring changes in my life and motivations is not cutting it. So I 
will try to incorporate discipline this time.

Why 100 days? I have a habbit of trying things for a week or two and then 
stopping. Before I can see any changes I make myself beleive that my efforts 
are in vain.

Not this time. I am going to incorporate the changes no matter how I feel in 
the next 100 days. I will talk more about these changes in next posts.

But for now, the 100 days start today i.e. 18 June 2025.
